Bridge between [Lightningmaps.org](http://lightningmaps.org/) and Pushbullet subscribers.
Now you can receive notifications on your phone when a thunderstorm is approaching or raging nearby. ⚡️

## How

1. Clone this repository.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Register your client
5. Enjoy ⚡️

## Notes

Be careful with the radius: since there is no pacing or strike grouping mechanisms yet, the poor subscriber might get hammered with notifications.
